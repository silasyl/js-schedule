# js-schedule
An app including backend and frontend to organize schedule

This app has a list of works, which can be accessed by month and year. It also shows how much works are done and undone. Their status can be switched.

Still need to be implemented:
- The changes are not reflecting on the backend (need to implement the route to write the new info)
